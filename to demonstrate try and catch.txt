Assisted Practice: 3.4 try-catch Statements
This section will guide you to: 
●	Write a program in Java to demonstrate try and catch
●	Use Eclipse (the popular text editor for Java programs) 
●	Push code to Git



Step 3.4.2: Writing a program in Java to demonstrate try and catch

public class MyClass 
{
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
        int[] array = new int[3];
        try 
        {
            array[7] = 3;
        }
        catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) 
        {
            System.out.println("Array index is out of bounds!"); 
        }
        finally 
        {
            System.out.println("The array is of size " + array.length);
        }
    }
}


****************Output******************

Array index is out of bounds!
The array is of size 3
