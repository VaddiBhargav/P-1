Assisted Practice: 3.2 Demonstrate the Execution of sleep() and wait()
This section will guide you to: 
●	Write a program in Java to demonstrate sleep() and wait()
●	Use Eclipse (the popular text editor for Java programs) 
●	Push code to Git



Step 3.2.2: Writing the program in Java to demonstrate sleep() and wait()
public class MyClass 
{
    private static Object LOCK = new Object();
    public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException
    {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        System.out.println("Thread '" + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "' is woken after sleeping for 1 second");
        synchronized (LOCK) 
        {
            LOCK.wait(1000);
            System.out.println("Object '" + LOCK + "' is woken after" + " waiting for 1 second");
        }
    }
}

Output:
 
Thread 'main' is woken after sleeping for 1 second
Object 'java.lang.Object@3caeaf62' is woken after waiting for 1 second
